1.3 notes

Welcome to 3rd video of this section.

In this section we will learn :
- What are functions in java script
- How do help us code efficiently
- Demo


In layman terms function is piece of code dedicated to carry out a specific task, if a function is carrying out multiple task then its a code smell and you might wanna revisit your design.
Function needs to be explicitly invoked in the code to carry out the task it owns.

Lets look at the app we have been building so far, we have already used functions in our ticker app where every button click event invokes the configured method. For e.g. checker button click invokes check() method to carry out assessment on whether count reached a definite value or not.

Function enabled to reuse one piece of code at multiple places in your project.


Demo!

Though we have already written some functions in our app, but lets write another simple method to understand it better.

Lets write a method to render “positive” or “negative” labels depending on our clicks directions.
